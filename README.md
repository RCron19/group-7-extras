# Extras needed for Lightsail to work
- Alternate docker-compose.yml for building on the instance
- lightsail-compose.yml and docker-compose-app.service are unneeded now
- `curl -o docker-compose.yml https://raw.githubusercontent.com/RCron19/group-7-extras/refs/heads/main/docker-compose.yml` copies the docker-compose.yml from this repo to the lightsail server
